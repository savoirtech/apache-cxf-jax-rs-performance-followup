== Apache CXF SOAP Performance Follow Up

In our last https://github.com/savoirtech/apache-cxf-jax-rs-performance[post], we recounted our journey to processing ~1.6 Billion JAX-RS calls in an eight-hour period. This lead to several readers reaching out with suggestions for tweaks to the scenarios run, or entirely new configurations. In this post we seek to provide some answers.

=== Brief Recap

After several iterations we found that we could reach peak throughput using the following Client and Server side settings:

[cols("1","1")]
|===
^| Parameter ^| Setting

| MAVEN_OPTS
| -Xms32m -Xmx8192m

| file handle ulimit
| /etc/security/limits.conf hard & soft limits increased to 655350

| ip_local_port_range
| sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="15000 64000" to allow 49K connections.

=============Overall Test Result============
Overall Throughput: get 1092.5105255070816 (invocations/sec)
Overall AVG. response time: 0.9153229892552811 (ms)
1.510322517E9 (invocations), running 1382432.921 (sec)
============================================

That's ?? invocations in eight hours.

== Can you try Java 21 again with Java 17's Heap & Tuning?

Sure!

=== How does that compare to our last Java 21 test?

In our prior lab test we achieved ?? calls in eight-hours, this run provided ?? - a delta improvement of ?? invocations.
